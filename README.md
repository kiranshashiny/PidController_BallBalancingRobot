# PidController_BallBalancingRobot

##### Code and Inspiration from http://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/

This project involves a PID controller which gives the signals to the servo motor to change directions and move the slider back and forth so that the ball balances at a certain set point on the scale at all times.


Items needed :

Arduino Uno

Servo Motor

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

10k Potentiometer
and some knowledge of Analog signals and concepts of the Ultrasonic distance finder/sensor.


See the Fritzing circuit diagram in this repo for how these components were connected.
